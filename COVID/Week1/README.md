# Week 1: April 5 thru April 11

## Introduction

In this lesson you will learn about the ArrayList data structure. As its name suggests, an ArrayList involves arrays. In fact, everything we learned concerning arrays can also be applied to ArrayList objects, however, with slightly different methods.

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the Set 29 ArrayList lesson [https://hpluska.github.io/APCompSciA/notes/set29ArrayLists.html](https://hpluska.github.io/APCompSciA/notes/set29ArrayLists.html)

    *  Read the entire lesson
    *  Watch all the lesson videos

- [ ] Locate the Set 29 Ticket Out The Door [https://hpluska.github.io/APCompSciA/ticketOutTheDoor/set29/Set29TicketOutTheDoorAPCompSciA.pdf](https://hpluska.github.io/APCompSciA/ticketOutTheDoor/set29/Set29TicketOutTheDoorAPCompSciA.pdf)

    *  Create a new *.java file.  Complete all the exercises in this file.  For each exercise, run the file and make sure the code works as intended.  This will require you to include print statements to ensure the resulting ArrayList has the correct contents.  

- [ ] Submit the Set 29 Ticket Out The Door
